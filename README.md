# Stories from the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada

The purpose of this repository is to facilitate storytelling surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, augmented by the vast amount of data and documents we have collected.

This effort is one component of the **[What Happened? COVID-19 in Canada](https://whathappened.coronavirus.icu/)** project. The data collected as part of this project (the [Timeline of COVID-19 in Canada](https://github.com/ccodwg/CovidTimelineCanada) and the [Canadian COVID-19 Data Archive](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19CanadaArchive)) may be used to enhance and provide context to stories about the pandemic.
